# About This Repository
This repository is dedicated to fun and information. It documents my journey in web development, showcasing the new techniques I learn in JavaScript, web development, and problem-solving with JavaScript, bootstrap and rect.js. I aim to share my knowledge to help others in their learning journey as well.
